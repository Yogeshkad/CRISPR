# Holochain Developer IDE



Use https://www.nodegit.org/ to manage merges with modified code.
When code is gemerated and written a new git branch will be created and the new code goes in there so any mods by a dev are not over written and can be merged in again by the dev.







Ideas
Skins:
- Desktop - Holochain (Electron)
- Web - Holo
- Mobile??
