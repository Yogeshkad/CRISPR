# Holochain Developer IDE



Use https://www.nodegit.org/ to manage merges with modified code.
When code is gemerated and written a new git branch will be created and the new code goes in there so any mods by a dev are not over written and can be merged in again by the dev.







Ideas
Skins:
- Desktop - Holochain (Electron)
- Web - Holo
- Mobile??

Players & Roles with Permissions per Entry Type or Anchor Type
- List
- Read
- Write
- Delete

Use Entity Builder in built hApp so new apps can be built.
Add fields, select view, edit, list templates
I can use this to build artist sites like http://philt3r.rocks
Select a template, the fields for the template get added like Profile Spec builder and Entity Builder.
Can build new templates and load them at runtime https://alligator.io/vuejs/v-runtime-template/
works just like Personas & Profiles, create a profile spec, save profiles.
